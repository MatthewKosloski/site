title: About This Site
---

Hello, and welcome to my online blog and portfolio!  The aesthetics of this website will never remain stationary; they will always change.  That's the beauty of having your own website.  It's a place where you can dictate the look and functionality of the experience.

This website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.  The typography is set in Avenir and Chaparral Pro.  If you're a curious individual who has the desire to have the source of my website, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/MatthewKosloski/site">here</a>.  

Please don't persecute me for how messy everything is, and how I don't use Sass.  I chose not to use Sass because I literally designed the site in the browser, and I didn't feel like setting up Sass.  It would come in handy if you know exactly what you're going to produceâ€” Although there were several occasions where I would of loved to have mixins.  I didn't adapt the DRY principle too well.
