## What is iOS Betas?

iOS Betas is a website where you can register your Apple device to retrieve the beta software serveral months before the fall release.  This service is extremely beneficial for individuals who are eager to beta test the new iOS software, but do not want to spent one-hundred dollars on an Apple developer account. 

## Started in 2012 with iOS 6

For the fourth year in a row, I was assigned to design and develop the iOS Betas website. This year it was done with WordPress. I created a custom, editable theme. I'm beginning to feel more comfortable with WordPress.
