#Site source for mtk.me and matthewkosloski.me

The aesthetics of this website will never remain stationary; they will always change. That’s the beauty of having your own website. It’s a place where you can dictate the look and functionality of the experience.

This website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. The typography is set in Avenir and Chaparral Pro. 

Please don’t persecute me for how messy everything is, and how I don’t use Sass. I chose not to use Sass because I literally designed the site in the browser, and I didn’t feel like setting up Sass. It would come in handy if you know exactly what you’re going to produce— Although there were several occasions where I would of loved to have mixins. I didn’t adapt the DRY principle too well.

Have fun, and happy coding!
