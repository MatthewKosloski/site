The aesthetics of this website will never remain stationary; they will always change. That’s the beauty of having your own website. It’s a place where you can dictate the look and functionality of the experience.

This website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. The typography is set in Avenir and Chaparral Pro. 

Have fun, and happy coding!
