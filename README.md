The aesthetics of this website will never remain stationary; they will always change. That’s the beauty of having your own website. It’s a place where you can dictate the look and functionality of the experience.

This website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. The typography is set in Avenir and Chaparral Pro. 

Have fun, and happy coding!

## Usage

### Removing Analytics

You are free to use this code anywhere in any way, and modify it however you'd like.  Just make sure to remove the analytics before deploying it on a remote server.  To do that, go to `_assets > js > app.js` and remove `//= require google-analytics` and `//= require gosquared`.  Then, delete those files within the `js` folder.

### Running it locally

To install Jekyll, run `gem install jekyll`
